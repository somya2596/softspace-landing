- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless compute
- **Amazon API Gateway** – Secure API exposure
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – User & reflection storage

- **Razorpay** – Payments & subscription handling
- **License Key System** – Secure Pro feature access

Designed with:
- **Privacy-first principles**
- **Low-latency serverless architecture**
- **Clear separation of concerns (UI, API, AI, billing)**

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This separation allows:

SoftSpace is built on a **privacy-first mindset**:
- No aggressive tracking
